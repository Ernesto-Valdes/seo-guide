<h1>Page Title</h1>
<p>A title tag tells both users and search engines what the topic of a particular page is. The <code>&lsaquo;
title&rsaquo;</code>
tag should be placed within the <code>&lsaquo;head&rsaquo;</code> tag of the HTML document (1). Ideally,
you should create a unique title for each page on your site.</p>

<h2>Accurately describe the page's content</h2>
<p>Choose a title that effectively communicates the topic of the page's content.</p>

<strong>Examples:</strong>

```html
<title>Select a Truck | Ryder Reservations</title>
```

```html
<title>Employee Theft Prevention Strategy &amp; Tips - Business | ADT Security Services</title>
```

<strong>Avoid:</strong>
<ul>
    <li>Choosing a title that has no relation to the content on the page</li>
    <li>using default or vague titles like "Untitled" or "New Page 1"</li>
</ul>
