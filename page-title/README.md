# Page Title

<p>A title tag tells both users and search engines what the topic of a particular page is. The <code>&lsaquo;title&rsaquo;</code> tag should be placed within the <code>&lsaquo;head&rsaquo;</code> tag of the HTML document. Ideally,
you should create a unique title for each page on your site.</p>

<p>If your document appears in a search results page, the contents of the title tag will usually appear in the first
line of the results.<p>

## Best Practices

### Accurately describe the page's content
<p>Choose a title that effectively communicates the topic of the page's content.</p>

<strong>Examples:</strong>

```html
<title>Select a Truck | Ryder Reservations</title>
```

```html
<title>Employee Theft Prevention Strategy &amp; Tips - Business | ADT Security Services</title>
```

<strong>Avoid:</strong>
<ul>
    <li>Choosing a title that has no relation to the content on the page</li>
    <li>using default or vague titles like "Untitled" or "New Page 1"</li>
</ul>

### Create unique title tags for each page
<p>Each of your pages should ideally have a unique title tag, which helps Google know how the page is distinct from
the others on your site.<p>

<strong>Avoid:</strong>
<ul>
    <li>using a single title tag across all of your site's pages or a large group of pages</li>
</ul>

### Use brief, but descriptive titles
<p>Titles can be both short and informative. If the title is too long, Google will show only a portion of it in the
search result.<p>

<strong>Avoid:</strong>
<ul>
    <li>using extremely lengthy titles that are unhelpful to users</li>
    <li>stuffing unneeded keywords in your title tags</li>
</ul>
