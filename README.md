<h2>SEO-Guide</h2>

Following these best practices will make it easier for search engines to crawl, index and understand your content.

"Search engine optimization is about putting your site's best foot forward when it comes to visibility in search engines, but your ultimate consumers are your users, not search engines." -google


<h3>Create unique, accurate page titles</h3>
A title tag tells both users and search engines what the topic of a particular page is.

Remember: Page title contents are displayed in search results

<h4>Best Practices</h4>
<ul>
	<li>Accurately describe the page's content</li>
	<li>Create unique title tags for each page</li>
	<li>Use brief, but descriptive titles</li>
</ul>

<code>&lt;title&gt;Page Title - Site Name | Brand&lt;/title&gt;</code>


<h3>Make use of the "description" meta tag</h3>
A page's description meta tag gives search engines a summary of what the page is about

<h4>Best Practices</h4>
<ul>
	<li>Accurately summarize the page's content</li>
	<li>Use unique descriptions for each page</li>
</ul>

<h2>Improve the structure of your URLs</h2>

Simple-to-understand URLs will convey content information easily. It could also lead to better crawling of your documents by search engines. If your URL contains relevant words, this provides users and search engines with more information about the page than an ID or oddly named parameter would. 

Remember: URLs are displayed in search results. 

<h4>Best Practices</h4>
<ul>
	<li>Use words in URLs</li>
	<li>Create a simple directory structure</li>
	<li>Provide one version of a URL to reach a document</li>
</ul>
