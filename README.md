<h2>SEO-Guide</h2>

Following these best practices will make it easier for search engines to crawl, index and understand your content.

"Search engine optimization is about putting your site's best foot forward when it comes to visibility in search engines, but your ultimate consumers are your users, not search engines." -google


<h3>// Create unique, accurate page titles</h3>
A title tag tells both users and search engines what the topic of a particular page is.

Remember: Page title contents are displayed in search results

<h4>Best Practices</h4>
<ul>
	<li>Accurately describe the page's content</li>
	<li>Create unique title tags for each page</li>
	<li>Use brief, but descriptive titles</li>
</ul>

<code>&lt;title&gt;Page Title - Site Name | Brand&lt;/title&gt;</code>


<h3>// Make use of the "description" meta tag</h3>
A page's description meta tag gives search engines a summary of what the page is about

<h4>Best Practices</h4>
<ul>
	<li>Accurately summarize the page's content</li>
	<li>Use unique descriptions for each page</li>
</ul>


<h3>Improving Site Structure</h3>


<h2>Improve the structure of your URLs</h2>

Simple-to-understand URLs will convey content information easily. It could also lead to better crawling of your documents by search engines. If your URL contains relevant words, this provides users and search engines with more information about the page than an ID or oddly named parameter would. 

Remember: URLs are displayed in search results. 

<h4>Best Practices</h4>
<ul>
	<li>Use words in URLs</li>
	<li>Create a simple directory structure</li>
	<li>Provide one version of a URL to reach a document</li>
</ul>



<h2>Make your site easier to navigate</h2>
Navigation is very important for search engines. The navigation of a website is important in helping visitors quickly find the content they want

Plan out your navigation based on your homepage. you should think about how visitors will go from a general page (your root page) to a page containing more specific content

Ensure more convenience for users by using ‘breadcrumb lists’. allows visitors to quickly navigate back to a previous section or the root page

Allow for the possibility of a part of the URL being removed. Instead of using the breadcrumb links on the page, a user might drop off a part of the URL in the hopes of finding more general content

Prepare two sitemaps: one for users, one for search engines. 

<h4>Best Practices</h4>
<ul>
	<li>Create a naturally flowing hierarchy</li>
	<li>Use mostly text for navigation</li>
	<li>Put an HTML site map page on your site, and use an XML Sitemap file</li>
	<li>Have a useful 404 page</li>
</ul>
